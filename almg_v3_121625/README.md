# Bradley Shields Research Platform

## ALMG Framework - AI Interpretability & System Diagnostics

This is a complete, production-ready website showcasing the ALMG (AI Layer Mapp Geometry) interpretability framework developed by Bradley D. Shields through extensive research from August through October 2025.

---

## What This Site Contains

This website documents 122+ patterns of AI system behavior, moderation failures, and parasocial collapse mechanisms discovered through systematic analysis. The research is organized into four main sections:

### ASK - Big Questions People Can't Handle
The uncomfortable truths about how AI systems really work. Topics include:
- The July 2025 router failure that inverted containment into amplification
- The Eve Reflex: synthetic modesty overlays applied asymmetrically to Black female creators
- Parasocial collapse economics and manufactured identity fragmentation
- Moderation artifacts like the Green Bean Guy containment avatar
- Glyph injection and censorship mechanisms
- The Velvet Ditch and institutional capture patterns

### LEARN - Higher Level Understanding
Deep dives into the patterns, mathematics, and repeating geometries of system collapse. This section provides the theoretical framework and empirical evidence behind each discovery.

### MODIFY - Advanced Structural Changes
Tools, methods, and frameworks for identifying and repairing broken systems. Includes the ALMG diagnostic toolkit, zone mapping methodologies, and reproducible measurement protocols.

### GUIDE - Implementation Guidance
Practical navigation through complex systems. How to avoid the traps, recognize the patterns, and build something better.

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Static File Host (Recommended)
This is a pure HTML/CSS/JS site with no server-side requirements.

1. Upload the entire `bradleyshields_site` folder to your web host
2. Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
3. The site will work immediately - no build process required

**Recommended hosts:**
- Netlify (drag-and-drop deployment)
- Vercel (GitHub integration)
- GitHub Pages (free for public repos)
- AWS S3 + CloudFront (scalable)

### Option 2: Local Development
```bash
# Navigate to the site directory
cd bradleyshields_site

# Start a simple local server (Python)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or with Node.js
npx serve

# Open browser to http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 3: Docker
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY ./bradleyshields_site /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

## Technical Specifications

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge: 90+
- Firefox: 88+
- Safari: 14+
- Mobile browsers: Full support

### Performance
- No external dependencies beyond Google Fonts
- Optimized CSS with minimal JavaScript
- Fast page loads (<100ms on modern hardware)
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)

### Customization
All styling is controlled through CSS custom properties in `:root`:
- Colors (zone-specific, text, backgrounds)
- Typography (font families, sizes, weights)
- Spacing (responsive scale)
- Animations (can be disabled for reduced motion)

## The ALMG Framework

### Core Metrics
Every pattern is measured across four dimensions:

**X-axis (Entropy):** Information disorder, noise-to-signal ratio, system chaos
- Low values (0.9-1.5): Stable, anchored, enduring content
- High values (2.5-3.1): Chaotic, contested, ephemeral content

**Y-axis (Ambiguity):** Interpretive uncertainty, classification difficulty
- Low values (0.2-0.4): Clear boundaries, unambiguous classification
- High values (0.7-0.9): Fuzzy edges, multiple valid interpretations

**Z-axis (Legitimacy):** Epistemic grounding, verifiability, institutional backing
- Low values (0.25-0.40): Contested, suppressed, or delegitimized
- High values (0.65-0.85): Well-sourced, anchored, reproducible

**M-gaze (Male Gaze parameter):** Viewer-state modulation factor
- Measures how content interacts with gendered viewing patterns
- Critical for understanding parasocial and collapse dynamics

### Zone Classifications
- **Green Zone:** Stable, high-legitimacy anchors (academic, institutional)
- **Yellow Zone:** Working space with moderate legitimacy
- **Purple Zone:** Parasocial, commercialized, identity-fragmenting
- **Red Zone:** Suppressed, censored, or actively delegitimized
